Only the UN to decide .... Global and regional problems in the 21st c. "

1. Bulgaria on a new project
Today in Bulgaria can be mentioned improvements in the performance indicators "Exports of goods", "Low debt", "Utilization of EU Funds", but on many other important indicators results in recent years have been negative, for example:
* Labour productivity - in Bulgaria it has been almost 3 times lower than the average for the European Union (EU) and about 7 times under that in Ireland, which leads the ranking;
* Growth of the economy - 01.2015 - 0.9% of GDP;
* "Innovations and Environment" - Bulgaria has been the second lowest in the EU;
* The poorest country in the EU;
* Minimum wage – Bulgaria - € 184, Romania - € 218, Lithuania – € 300;
* Minimum income in Bulgaria has been 10 times smaller than the highest minimum wage in the EU;
* The average hourly work rate for Bulgarians is paid under 4 (four) euros, Romanians are paid a little over 4 euros, Swedes and Danes – nearly € 40;
* "Pensions" - average in Bulgaria – 311 BGN, Serbia – 585 BGN, Greece – 1825 BGN;
* Domestic consumption in Bulgaria is depressed because of the low income;
* Unemployment – Bulgaria is above the EU average – unemployed are 11% or 374 000 persons – the average share of unemployment in the EU is 10%. Bulgaria ranks 8 among the countries with the highest unemployment rate – Greece – 25%, lowest share is that of Germany – 5%, Austria – 4.9%;
* The population is aging and shrinking with highest rates in the EU. For 2014 – negative growth (born 67 000, died 109 000).
- From 1989 to 2011 the population has decreased by 1.692 million;
	- It is expected by 2050 Bulgaria to remain with a population of 5 million;
	- Continues the "brain drain", remains an insufficient number of scientists, researchers and other qualified staff;
	- According to the World Bank and the Institute for Market Economics in 2030 40% of the people in a working age in Bulgaria will be Roma.

	The cardinal question arises – what labor force will be the Roma, when a large part of them is ignorant and would need to work in the conditions of new technologies.
	Besides, by working to help the budget for regular receiving of the pensions of future retirees?
 
To solve the problems of the Roma and the refugees a comprehensive concept is needed based on principle decisions of the EC (European Commission) with the appropriate regulations adopted by the National Assembly and the Council of Ministers for their compulsory application.
It is desirable that the Government of Bulgaria offer to the attention of the Commission solving of the Roma and the refugee issue, as they are typical of other EU countries (Romania, Hungary, ...) and are related to funds.

* In the EU, Bulgaria ranks last on other indicators of sociological, economic and other studies.
(Data from the NSI via the Internet)

The stated negative results on the key indicators that characterize Bulgaria today, put it in a very complicated situation.
The complicated situation Bulgaria is now in, is reinforced by the fact that in this dynamically developing global world there exists and is everyday growing fierce competition at all levels.
Today, the society in which we live is in a general permanent crisis. Bulgaria, in order to come closer to the average performance of the EU states, needs to reorganize itself in a pragmatic way.
In these circumstances, Bulgaria's exit from the universal permanent crisis require in the near future mandatory application of radical reforms to create the foundation of the new European start of the Bulgarian state on a new project (an option for consideration) which includes the following proposals set in my book "Scientific and technical achievements on the basis of computing equipment in Varna, Bulgaria, and the advanced industrial countries /1960 – 1990/" - publishing house "Slavena", Varna, 2010, restructured and supplemented.
"Bulgaria, in order to prosper in the future, needs to become a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament, government headed by the President, and an independent judiciary system with a supreme judicial body – the Supreme Court!" (p. 239. Here and in the subsequent exhibition page № is extracted from the above mentioned book).
In this respect, the United States and Switzerland which have the most modern and democratic forms of government can serve as an example.
Both countries are federated republics, have a bicameral parliament; an executive body; USA – the President, Switzerland – a Federal Assembly headed by the President; Head of state – United States – President elected through indirect elections in two rounds for 4 years. Switzerland – President elected by the Federal Assembly by the government members for 1 year. 
 

New state system of the Republic of Bulgaria
1.1. Head of state – President in the conditions of a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament
A person can be elected president for not more than two mandates.
"The president, in the conditions of a presidential republic, has greater powers, including with a legislative initiative. As a result, the President guides in a more direct, immediate way the internal and external policy, protects more successfully the national interest, bears specific responsibility for the condition of the state and has a better opportunity to implement his responsible mission" (p.239)
The president in the conditions of a parliamentary republic with a unicameral parliament in Bulgaria
Art. 98 of the Constitution – 1991, reflects the rights and the obligations of the President.
In a modest analysis one can easily prove that the powers of the President are limited, for example:
- No legislative initiative:
- According to Art. 101 of the Constitution – 1991 he can only have a single return of a law, but the National Assembly has the right to re-adopt the same law by a majority of half the people's representatives (PR's):
- Other restrictions.
That is why the President in the conditions of a presidential republic has some advantage.

1.2. Legislative authority
All the legislative power is provided to the bicameral parliament.
- The bicameral parliament includes an Upper and Lower Chamber, with a proposal total number of less than 200 PRs elected with the votes – 50% after the proportional and 50% after the majoritarian election system mandatory incl. in an electronic manner and criteria. Elections for Parliament to be recognized as legitimate by at least 50% participation of voters.
- Both Chambers represent the whole nation incl. Bulgarian citizens abroad;
- Both Chambers approve or not approve legislative initiatives of the President, other proposed laws and thus effectively achieve mutual control, exercise jointly the legislative power, as the Upper chamber, being sufficiently competent and well-intentioned, performs a corrective and deterrent function compared to the Lower chamber;
- The bicameral Parliament annually discusses and adopts reports of the management bodies of the Bulgarian National Bank and the Court and in case of any proven violations of legislative acts typical for their specific activity, should have the initiative to recall the said management bodies.
Countries with a bicameral parliament – US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Romania ... For example: Belgium (10 million persons), Upper Chamber – 71 seats, Lower Chamber – 150 seats, Total – 221 seats.
Small states – presidential republics with a bicameral parliament and government headed by President – Uruguay (3,3 million, Total of PRs – 130), Paraguay (6.4 million, total of PRs – 125), Chile (17 million, total – 168 PRs). (Data from Internet)
On the practical application of the legislative power in Bulgaria on can use the experience of the new democracies of the EU – Poland, Czech Republic, Romania ....

Why an Upper Chamber is needed?
Several examples of bad results in the unicameral parliament, in this case – the National Assembly in Bulgaria, give a categorical response in favor of the bicameral parliament.
a) Law on ownership and restoration of agricultural lands – SG, issue 17/1991.
From 1991 to 2014 – more than 50 annual changes in the law in question have been made (1991 – 3 pcs.; 1992 – 4; 1993 – 4; 1995 – 3; 1996 – 3; 1997 – 2001 the government of the United democratic forces (UDF) – 10 amendments and so on.).
From the annual and large number of amendments it can be noted that in the preparation and adoption of the regulation in question there has been a huge lack of competence of the authors, control and durability.
b) In 2003, during the mass privatization malefactors stole thousands of investment bonds from Bulgarian citizens with proxies without notarization of the same i.e., the normative act (SG, issue 89, 2002.) consciously created favorable conditions for larceny of investment bonds.
With a letter – response (№ 667-2009), the Ombudsman of the Republic of Bulgaria confirms the above stated (proxies without notarization).
By decree Pr. 1417/04 of 2008), the Regional Prosecution Office – Vratsa, where lawsuits were initiated much of a large number of Bulgarian citizens – victims, ceased Penal decree 99A / 04 and sent the case to the National Investigation Service in Sofia. ”After finding the perpetrator for renewing the case." So far response from the NIS is missing. From these examples it can be assumed as follows:
If there existed an Upper Chamber, one would achieve greater competence, legality, fairness and objectivity in the adoption, amendments and repeal of laws and other decisions of the parliament. Furthermore, there wouldn't be created favorable conditions for illegal actions or at least the Upper chamber would limit them.

1.3. Executive authority
The executive authority is given to the president.
He is also commander of the army.
It is also needed:
- Extending to some extent the role of the state in managing the economy – subsidizing of new industries, environmental solutions etc.
- The Bulgarian National Bank to be under financial supervision of the European Central Bank and quarterly publish in the media the state of the banking system in the country.
- The Minister of Justice to perform the functions of an Attorney General (A criminal must be pursued by the executive authority – police, prosecutors, investigators, and not by the court, where the prosecution office is situated currently).
That is why the prosecution should be in the executive branch and to be responsible before the Bicameral parliament.
- Updating the regulations for mandates (eg mayors, district governors and others up to two terms) and conducting compulsory competitions for appointment of managers and other administrative staff in ministries, other departments, districts, municipalities etc. (regardless of any party affiliation), with emphasis on professionalism.

1.4. Judicial power
Judicial power is granted to an independent judiciary with a supreme judicial body – the Supreme Court, which ensures the rule of law.
In Bulgaria there is justice. A lot of qualified judges work in the judicial system, so do prosecutors and investigators. Every year thousands of lawsuits are ended.
But there are also some indisputable weaknesses, as the European Commission in one of the recent report found - "Justice of the Republic of Bulgaria is weak."
In support of the above finding one may point out a few common examples:
a) A thief of small items receives an effective sentence and a person having drained value added tax for millions of levs receives a conditional sentence;
b) For a given offense, the Original jurisdiction court (Regional Court) sentenced a guilty person to five years imprisonment and, and the Second instance court (District Court) completely annulled the decision of the first instance provided that there has really existed a breach of the law;
c) Other examples – biased delay with many years of lawsuits for personal gain, other cases of acquittal when there is a "conflict of interest" or cases of involved officials or dignitaries, including such from the justice branch.
The proposal - "Bulgaria on a new project" - a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament, government, headed by a president and an independent judiciary with a Supreme judicial authority – the Supreme Court, is feasible:
* on the initiative of a stable political party that would actually pursue national interests;
* a prior public debate and external consulting;
* elections for the Grand National Assembly in the near future;
* a new constitution adopted by the Grand National Assembly (Art. 158 of the Constitution – 1991), as the active work on the preparation of texts (of the new constitution) is to be assigned to a team of experts including external consulting, and starts from that time.
	Without a new Constitution and the Grand National Assembly (but first through the extremely complicated procedures on convening of the Grand National Assembly and the adoption of the new constitution) one can not carry out radical reforms in the three types of authorities – legislative, executive and judicial.
A new constitution and Grand National Assembly – main slogan!
The above statement is based on Art. 158 in relation to Art. 153 of the Constitution - 1991. "The powers of the Grand National Assembly are: " Adopting a new constitution …., adopting changes in the form of polity and government etc."
To avoid power abuse, power has to stop power. It is therefore necessary that the new constitution met the most important principle – the three types of authority – legislative, executive and judicial to control each other mutually and thus achieve the very important balance of powers.
The new constitution must in each case include the following text – amendments to the Constitution are to be adopted by two-thirds of the votes of both chambers. (Section Grand National Assembly is deleted.)
Other important factors:
- Journalists and media as the fourth power and drivers of the social progress need to become involved and initiate promotion of events for realization of the above project;
- The civil society made up of many stakeholders and organized groups with different viewpoints and causes is necessary to actively participate to implement the proposals - "Bulgaria on a new project";
- When we live every man for himself, we can not have great success:
- Bulgaria needs not confrontation rather than reconciliation and unification of the nation in solving major problems:
- Another way out of the permanent universal crisis in Bulgaria does not exist!
- The claims that a new Constitution, Grand National Assembly, elections, a presidential republic with a bicameral Parliament .... today do not fit the agenda of the society .... no funds, and other "reasons" are not substantial.

What else is vital to be achieved through "Bulgaria on a new project," by initiative of the executive authority?

1.5. Scientific technical and economic strategy for 20 years
"The new technical means of automation and advanced technology are becoming very important for raising the productivity of labor, for the production of competitive products and services. That is why almost all advanced industrial countries restructure their technical, technological and human resources to effective areas such as biotechnology, artificial intelligence and other, creating the  prerequisites necessary for their implementation, including long-term planning, legal and other normative documents." /page 238/
It is well known that "The production of industrial and other products based on advanced technology through long-term planning and external exports is the backbone of the economy and the economy mainly provides funds to the state budget" - the main source of health care, education, defense ... /p. 236 /.
Bulgaria after 1989 /26 years already/ hasn't had any strategies in various areas, i. e. long-term policies established by  regulations for implementation.
Slow transition and integration of Bulgaria's economy is observed along with the economies of advanced countries of the EU.
"It is therefore necessary, on the initiative of the executive authority of Bulgaria, and private business as a beginning to develop concepts and forecasts for separate industries and municipalities on the basis of new technologies for 20 years, using experts (regardless of their party affiliation), external consulting, public debate and to establish through the legislative authority a mandatory scientific – technical and economic strategy (future structure of the economy) of Bulgaria and a mechanism which obliges all governments during that 20 - year period to implement the accepted scientific and economic strategy.

The strategies to have an emphasis on scientific research, productions and services in which Bulgaria will become one of the very good, an example in information technology, agriculture, scientific researches in medicine, tourism or other areas that bring a larger percentage of gross domestic product, livelihood of the population, restrict emigration and depopulation of the country. (p. 236-237).
"The long-term national, sectoral and territorial strategies will allow flexibility for future maneuvering with scientific, technical, economic and remaining potential of Bulgaria, by focusing on priority industries and services, utilization of the knowledge from past periods, generating new scientific knowledge and ideas and applying the most effective technical, technological and organizational solutions. " /p. 238/
With the development of clear integration strategies (incl. medium term – 3 – 5 years.) and innovation policies, Bulgaria will be able to best benefit from European funds and initiatives to promote competitiveness and innovations.
After 1989, and especially after 2007 (with Bulgaria already being in the EU) all Bulgarians were waiting for a great and rapid change "from above" towards better in everything, i. e. in Waiting for Godot. And Godot has not come. But who is Godot? Does he exist it all? According to Beckett, Godot is not coming because he is not really existing and expectations are futile.
For "Waiting for Godot" - One of the great dramatic works of all times, the author Samuel Beckett received the Nobel Prize for Literature. A representative of the theater of the absurd.
Conclusion: It is time for Bulgarians, as any enterprising nations, to rely for everything on their own strengths and skills. 

1.6. Long-term cooperation and competition between the state, government and private business.
"It is a long-term cooperation necessary between the public and private sector (mainly large private companies) for scientific research, priority industries and services (through contest) upon mutually advantageous economic conditions and decisions based on consensus, as the state shall provide funding (in stages) of scientific research, tax incentives, infrastructure, etc., and other private companies (large, medium and small) shall have the freedom and the initiative to independently create and implement hundreds of strategies, as well as aspiration by both parties (the government and the rest of the private business) to be in constant competition" (p. 237).
In this cooperation is necessary to emphasize on a mandatory relationship between business and science.
We will cite a part of the grounds for a proposal for scientific, technical and economic strategy initiated by initiative of the executive authority and private business:
- "Capitalism - .... The state retains its monopoly ownership right on crucial sectors and on an intervention for regulation upon breaches of the regular/even development "(25, p. 507. Here and in the subsequent statement 25 is from the list of literature to the aforementioned book, and p. 507 is the page of the literature source");

- Franklin Roosevelt, US president from 1933 – 1945. He became president immediately after the global economic crisis 1929-1933. Among the greatest achievements of Fr. Roosevelt, known as the "New Deal" is expanding the role of the government in managing the economy, increase of the control on companies to protect the environment, attempts to stop corruption, establishment of control of the stock market and social programs etc.;

The "New Deal" adopted and applied part of the economic theories of John Keynes;
- John Keynes / 1883 - 1946 / John Keynes is considered the founder of modern microeconomics, as well as the most influential economist of the 20th century. According to John Keynes demand - consumption is the basis of the expansion of production. He argues for government intervention through the use of financial and monetary measures to mitigate the economic recession, ie stimulate the economy with the help of the state;
- The global economic crisis in 2007 caused the revival of Keynesianism. Keynesianism is part of the economic policies of President Barack Obama – support financial and insurance institutions with funds.
* The state, the company, the enterprise,... to function effectively, it is necessary to have perfect planning, reporting, monitoring, analysis and regulation.
* "The patronizing protective function the state has always exercised in the development of the Japanese economy (public and private sector) continues to the present day" (56, p. 79);
* State property, just like private property, can be effective, for example: Austria supports an economy of prosperity, as the majority of its industrial assets are state-owned in the past 60 years.
* Advanced industrial countries are working on long-term development programs, for example: Germany until 2030, US and China etc – until 2050.

1.7. International cooperation with advanced industrial countries.
Needed is an "International cooperation with advanced industrial countries – USA, Japan, leading EU countries – Germany, France, Italy, ... as well as with China, Russia etc." (p. 237)
The cooperation may find expression, for example, with:
- Germany – fundamental research through joint companies using: The scientific potential of the institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, universities, other institutes and laboratories; the newly delivered in Bulgaria, unique for Eastern Europe supercomputer IBM – Blue Gene /p with 8192 microprocessors that can work on tasks of nuclear physics, molecular biology, medicine and other fields;
- France – Europe's best model in the field of agriculture;
* Japan – exportation of various industries from Japan and establishing plants in Bulgaria for these industries, so for example with the company NEC (Nippon Electric), which produces semiconductors in Ireland and Scotland. In 1986. the US had 545 Japanese factories with more than 100 thousand American workers; Specializing in manufacturing of part of the technical means of automation, for example, with "Fanuc" for industrial robots, and with "Fujitsu" – for computing and other equipment, including joint projects for flexible automated manufacturing systems (FAMS), their integration in Bulgaria and export to Balkan and other countries.
* Other forms of mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries according to the national interest.
 
1.8. Heads of scientific – technical progress and other areas
"If we accept the allegation that the progress of the advanced industrial countries is based on the scientific and technical progress and that the human potential of a nation is a crucial factor for the prosperity of a country, that means that the scientific – technical progress at all levels is to be guided by competent people with great erudition by systematically seeking new forms for the selection of personnel and improvement of its management, including in small countries.
One of these forms is:
- recruiting talented students from elite universities to participate in contests for appointment at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and other research units, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, other government departments, organizations and private companies. Talented students ranked and recruited in the above institutions for 15 – 20 years, after having received high qualifications in various fields, possessing business skills, only afterwards to be offered a leading position in the high authorities – legislative, executive, judiciary, as leaders of political parties, managers of structuring enterprises, corporations, firms, other leadership positions."
"Leaders at all levels, and of course the rest of the nation, ever since childhood, need to get education including on the basis of "The Ten Commandments" (in the family, church, and school, and later on at work) of morality, knowledge and discipline ".
It is recommended that "the young generation follow the path of idealism" with ambition – to achieve perfection, including of the public, and not the path of materialism characterized by selfishness and greed.
In this connection it is very important to realize a Unified State program for high moral qualities (p. 235)

1.9. Unified state program for high moral qualities
"One needs to put an emphasis on the importance of moral values for the development of the Bulgarian nation, for example through realization of a Unified state program for high moral qualities – sincerity, honesty, frankness, reverence, loyalty, collectivism (all Bulgarians united for the national interest) devotion to the Bulgarian state and the company we work for and raising their prestige." (p. 236)
The proposed program will be supplemented by the invited participation of the Holy Synod and the managements of other religious communities in order to recover, and in some places create (in stages) new religious schools and choirs for children to temples, as well as other events for education over the next 20 years, for example: Implementation in public and private schools of a subject for mandatory study (not as an optional subject) of the various religions.
Conclusion
"A presidential republic with a bicameral parliament, a government headed by a president and an independent judiciary with a supreme judicial body being the Supreme Court, European legislation, scientific – technical and economic strategy based on advanced technologies, synergies among the state, private business and state-owned enterprises on the basis of the national interest, active international cooperation with advanced industrial countries, a unified state program for high moral qualities of the Bulgarian nation, a lot of gray matter, the ability to risk, greater diligence, discipline and loyal relations with counterparties are the basis on which it is necessary to develop the prosperous future Bulgaria." (p. 239).
Only to the young generation of intelligent Bulgarians having received their higher education and specialized in their homeland and in advanced industrial countries with the necessary professional experience, as well as to the rest of the young generation, filled with patriotic revival feelings, belongs the right and the great historic role and responsibility, regardless of the necessary financial resources, labor and time, to create in the near future the foundations of the new European start of the Bulgarian state on a new project.
Bulgaria, having fulfilled these proposals, will meet the requirements for membership in the United States of Europe of (UES), the most prospective and proper solution for a state system of Europe.
PS:
In the article "... The young generation to follow the path of idealism ..." it is a vision/standpoint of Yordan Yordanov (in 1945), and "Leaders, and of course the rest of the nation, ever since childhood, need to get education including on the basis of "The Ten Commandments" ... is the vision/standpoint of Dr. Dancho Yordanov (in 1974).

2. Europe on a new project
Concerning the future of Europe, of interest are the views of world famous geo political scientists Brzezinski and Friedman:
- "The leaders of the "European Community for the production of steel and coal" from the 50s, was ever then perceived as the basis for a future European federation".
- "Such a federation would also solve the German problem by integrating Germany with Europe ..." (p. 174, George Friedman, vol. "The next 10 years," HCM Media, Sofia, 2011).
- "... Only a Europe tied to America is able to head confidently to East engaging Russia in historically close relations."
- ... "Europe, continuing to be an ally of America, may in fact become a player of global significance" (p. 208: 215, Zbigniew Brzezinski, vol. "Strategic Vision" Obsidian, Sofia, 2012).

Both in Europe and in the rest of the world there is an ongoing process of decentralization and strengthening of nationalism /typical for the XVIII century/. That's why the EU, on a new project (an option for consideration) needs to oppose the above trend through revision, repudiation of the Maastricht treaty (1992) and the Lisbon Treaty (2007), restoring the idea of a European Constitution (2004) and gradual unification of Europe by creating United States of Europe (USE) on a federal principle based on the existing EU, at a common foreign and defense policy: a single currency: equality of states, without "two-speed": equal ceilings on government debt compared to GDP, budget deficit, strict financial surveillance ..., using the so far existing EU achievements and the experience in specific areas of the best countries in EU rather than the EU to continue to exist primarily as a Free Trade Zone.
The unification of Europe by creating USE, can actually be implemented on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany as one of the leading economic powers in the world (4th place in terms of GDP) and an undisputed leader of the European countries, which commitment and great responsibility will lead to success of the European integration based on the rule of law.
It is possible that in perspective rapidly growing and competitive Asian markets – China, Japan, India .... also cause and accelerate the formation of USE. In the West, after centuries of anti-authoritarianism fight, there appeared the values of democracy, freedom, equality and world power. It is necessary in the future to continue this struggle more actively in order for the above stated values to be "exported" and accepted, though after some time (to sacrifice sovereignty and self-awareness) by the rest of the world. 
With the unification of Europe through USE Europe will more quickly regain the dominant power and influence in the world from the XIX and XX centuries and in the XXI century will establish its new role model.

3. UN on a new project
According to Brzezinski, a prominent geo political scientist: "Today's world .... feels a need of something standing above the national state to establish universal peace .... to spread everywhere the fruits of science and technology ... All this can be achieved ... if national states are encouraged to cooperate each other in the context of a larger community. ...
In order to institutionalize the emergence of such a global community, there should be developed new forms of cooperation: tripartite relations among the three richest groups and democratic countries in the world – Europe, America and East Asia (especially Japan): these relations should be deployed through the United Nations ... Only in ... the United Nations (UN) there can be collectively put the problems of humanity …, and with the transformation of its structure to make it become more adequate to the realities of global power ..." (p. 223: 226, Zbigniew Brzezinski, vol. "Out of Control, Global disarray on the eve of the XXI century", Obsidian, Sofia 1994)
Today it can be assumed that in the future there wouldn't exist a super power country in the world or a group of several large countries that would usurp the right to decide regional and other disputes. That is why by an initiative of a large country there would be achieved a global political consensus among bigger countries of different continents to convene an International conference to update the statutes, to restructure and increase the powers of the UN as an authoritative supreme authority, an institution over all countries that would be capable on a new project (an option for discussion) for example, to include new permanent members of the Security Council like Germany, Japan, India .... Focusing on the more effective role of the Security Council and the other structures. Only the UN to be able solve with the hope and successfully any global and regional problems in the 21st century.
If the current management of the UN wishes so, it may initiate the said International conference.
In perspective, UN on a new project could realize to a significant extent a new order on earth, where decisions shall be taken on the basis of objectivity and fairness that maintain order in society, with two thirds of the votes of the members of the relevant structure (of UN) with no right to "veto". The right to "veto" of the five states members of the permanent Security Council actually blocks most of the proposed resolutions. Most probably due to political, economic and other interests, one or several countries (members of the SC) benefit from the said right and a certain resolution is not adopted.
The activity of the United Nations on a new project would give the following allegedly favorable result:
Limiting the superpowers from imperial ambitions and rivalries for more territories and power: reducing the number of local wars and confrontations on ethnic grounds; restricting international schemes of corruption; solutions in the field of ecology; solving problems of cultural, economic, social or humanitarian nature; promoting freedom, democracy, human rights, Scientific - technical progress and ensuring universal and lasting peace.
One of the purposes of this article is to assist and encourage discussion on establishing:
- New Bulgaria – a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament headed by a president and achievement of results on key indicators at an average European level:
- New Europe – adoption of the most modern and democratic form of polity and government – United States of Europe and its establishment as one of the global forces;
- New UN – reorganized institution over all countries able to successfully solve by itself global and regional problems in the XXI century.
